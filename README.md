## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying DNA sequences from human and chimpanzee datasets based on protein sequence data of seven different proteins: 'G protein-coupled receptors', 'Tyrosine Kinase', 'Tyrosine phosphatase', 'Synthetase', 'Synthase', 'Ion channel', and 'Transcription Factor'. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to differentiate between the DNA sequences of these two species using their protein sequence data.

## Project Overview
- Utilize protein sequence data of seven different proteins from human and chimpanzee datasets.
- Implement machine learning models for DNA classification.
- Evaluate the models' performance on distinguishing human and chimpanzee DNA sequences.
- Provide insightful visualizations and reports for analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of protein sequences from human and chimpanzee genomes for the specified protein categories. The dataset is organized into training and testing subsets.


## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Protein sequences are processed and converted into suitable input features for machine learning models.
2. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and deep neural networks, are considered for classification.
3. Training and Evaluation: Models are trained on the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
4. Comparative Analysis: The project provides a detailed comparison of classification results for different protein categories.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for neural network models)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Flask (for the classification interface)
- [Add any other specific dependencies]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purvadhamodikar/dna_classification.git
   cd dna_classification

## Results
The machine learning models demonstrate promising performance in distinguishing between human and chimpanzee DNA sequences for the specified protein categories. The project provides comprehensive results and visualizations for further analysis.
